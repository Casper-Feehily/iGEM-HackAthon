# iGEM Hackathon 2024: Human Practices Maturity Model Toolkit
In this repository there are two Toolkit´s that your team can use to evaluate, your teams Human Practices Page.
Both Toolkit´s are based on the human Practices maturity model (https://responsibility.igem.org/human-practices/maturity-model).
The first tool you can use to evaluate your Human Practices program by your self, via a questionary. Just click on the how you agree/Disagree with each of the statements that are made.

The second tool kit is based on an AI model, that evaluates your Teams HP wiki page, via the human Practices maturity mode. It grades your text, and also gives suggestions on how to improve your text for certain aspects.
For this, you need an API-Key from the Web-site Hugging Face Inference. You can easily login and get your free tier Key that works with this kit. :)
## Getting started
Download and run the respective Toolkit html files. For the User-Self-Evaluation you also need to download the styles.css file.
